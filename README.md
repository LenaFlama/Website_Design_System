A HTML & CSS project 
In this project, I be building my own basic design system for a website. In essence, Iâ€™ll be building a website to help me build MORE websites in the future. On my site, I'll collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles.

Extra: 

Adding additional components(buttons)
Learning how and then implementing a responsive design so that your site looks great on all screen sizes.
Adding navigation and splitting up the site so that each section has its own HTML page.# Website_Design_System
